# Shopping List

**Note:** This is a work in progress.

Shopping List is an Offline First demo Progressive Web App built using Polymer and PouchDB. Mult-user / multi-device capabilities are enabled by Hoodie. [This app is part of a series of Offline First demo apps, each built using a different stack.](https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/shopping-list)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)):

    npm install --global polymer-cli

Second, install [Bower](https://bower.io/) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

    npm install --global bower

### Running the Development Server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL routing for the app:

    polymer serve

### Building

The `polymer build` command builds your Polymer application for production, using build configuration options provided by the command line or in your project's `polymer.json` file.  

You can configure your `polymer.json` file to create multiple builds. This is necessary if you will be serving different builds optimized for different browsers. You can define your own named builds, or use presets. See the documentation on [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production) for more information.

This app is configured to create three builds using [the three supported presets](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production#build-presets):

```
"builds": [
  {
    "preset": "es5-bundled"
  },
  {
    "preset": "es6-bundled"
  },
  {
    "preset": "es6-unbundled"
  }
]
```

Builds will be output to a subdirectory under the `build/` directory as follows:

```
build/
  es5-bundled/
  es6-bundled/
  es6-unbundled/
```

* `es5-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is compiled to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.
* `es6-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that can handle ES6 code - see [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production#compiling) for a list.
* `es6-unbundled` is an unbundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that support HTTP/2 push.

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production).

### Previewing the Build

This command serves your app. Replace `build-folder-name` with the folder name of the build you want to serve:

    polymer serve build/build-folder-name/

### Running the Tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    polymer test

If running Windows you will need to set the following environment variables:

- LAUNCHPAD_BROWSERS
- LAUNCHPAD_CHROME

### Adding a New View

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections of the application. Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the list of `fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file. This will ensure those components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached components and will be included in the build.

## Features

Shopping List is a simple demo app, with a limited feature set. Here is a list of features written as user stories grouped by Epic:

* Planning
  * As a \<person planning to shop for groceries\>, I want to \<create a shopping list\> so that \<I can add items to this shopping list\>.
  * As a \<person planning to shop for groceries\>, I want to \<add an item to my shopping list\> so that \<I can remember to buy that item when I am at the grocery store later\>.
  * As a \<person planning to shop for groceries\>, I want to \<remove an item from my shopping list\> so that \<I can change my mind on what to buy when I am at the grocery store later\>.
* Shopping
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<view items on my shopping list\> so that \<I can remember what items to buy\>.
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<add an item to my shopping list\> so that \<I can remember to buy that item\>.
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<remove an item from my shopping list\> so that \<I can change my mind on what to buy\>.
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<check off an item on my shopping list\> so that \<I can keep track of what items I have bought\>.
* Offline First
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<have the app installed on my device\> so that \<I can continue to utilize my shopping list when no internet connection is available\>.
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<have my shopping list stored locally on my device\> so that \<I can continue to utilize my shopping list when no internet connection is available\>.
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<sync my shopping list with the cloud\> so that \<I can manage and utilize my shopping list on multiple devices\>.
* Multi-User / Multi-Device
  * As a \<new user\>, I want to \<sign up for the app\> so that \<I can use the app\>.
  * As an \<existing user\>, I want to \<sign in to the app\> so that \<I can use the app\>.
  * As an \<existing user\>, I want to \<sign out of the app\> so that \<I can protect my privacy\>.
* Geolocation
  * As a \<person planning to shop for groceries\>, I want to \<associate a shopping list with a grocery store\> so that \<I can be notified of this shopping list when I am physically at that grocery store\>.
  * As a \<person associating a shopping list with a physical store\>, I want to \<access previously-used locations\> so that \<I can quickly find the physical store for which I am searching\>.
  * As a \<person shopping for groceries\>, I want to \<be notified of a shopping list when I am physically at the grocery store associated with that shopping list\> so that \<I can quickly find the shopping list for my current context\>.

## App Architecture

This app uses a drawer-based layout. The layout is provided by Polymer's `app-layout` elements.

This app, along with the `polymer-cli` toolchain, uses the "PRPL pattern" This pattern allows fast first delivery and interaction with the content at the initial route requested by the user, along with fast subsequent navigation by pre-caching the remaining components required by the app and progressively loading them on-demand as the user navigates through the app.

The PRPL pattern, in a nutshell:

* **Push** components required for the initial route
* **Render** initial route ASAP
* **Pre-cache** components for remaining routes
* **Lazy-load** and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand
